# Simplified LLM Workflow Builder - Implementation Plan

## Overview & Purpose

The LLM Workflow Builder is a comprehensive system that enables users to create and modify complex workflow definitions
through natural language conversations with AI agents. Instead of manually configuring workflow nodes, task definitions,
connections, and prompts, users can simply describe what they want to accomplish, and the system will intelligently
design, build, and implement the complete workflow structure.

### Key Goals:

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Users interact through conversational prompts rather than technical configuration
2. **Intelligent Workflow Design**: AI analyzes requirements and designs optimal workflow structures
3. **Automated Implementation**: System creates all necessary models (WorkflowDefinition, TaskDefinition, WorkflowNode,
   etc.)
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Chat-based interface allows continuous improvement and modification
5. **Integration with Existing System**: Leverages current workflow engine without disruption

### How It Works:

The system operates in three distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Requirements Gathering** - User provides natural language description of their workflow needs. AI engages in
conversation to understand requirements, clarify ambiguities, and propose a high-level workflow plan.

**Phase 2: Workflow Building** - Once the plan is approved, the system uses a specialized "Workflow Builder" workflow to
automatically create all technical components: task definitions with appropriate prompts, agents, schema definitions,
workflow connections, and artifact flow configurations.

**Phase 3: Result Evaluation** - After the workflow is built, AI analyzes the results, explains what was created, and
provides recommendations. Users can then request modifications or start building additional workflows.

### User Experience:

Users interact through an artisan command that provides a chat-like interface:

```bash
sail artisan workflow:build "Create a content analysis workflow that extracts key insights"
```

The system guides users through the process, displays progress, and provides clear feedback about what was built and how
to use it.

### Technical Architecture:

Built on the existing workflow engine, the system uses specialized task runners, direct AgentThreadService integration,
and event-driven completion handling to provide a seamless experience while maintaining clean separation of concerns and
reusability.

## 6. Hard-Coded Workflow Definition

**Location**: Database Seeder or Migration
**Creates**: "LLM Workflow Builder" WorkflowDefinition

**Structure:**

```
Node 1: WorkflowInput (WorkflowInputTaskRunner)
  ↓
Node 2: Workflow Orchestrator (WorkflowDefinitionBuilderTaskRunner)
  - Output artifact mode: "split by task"
  - Timeout: 120s (configured in task definition)
  ↓
Node 3: Task Definition Builder (TaskDefinitionBuilderTaskRunner)
  - Input artifact mode: "split" (parallel processing)
  - Output: Individual task definitions
  ↓
Node 4: WorkflowOutput (WorkflowOutputTaskRunner)
```

**Note**: This workflow only handles the building phase. Planning and evaluation are handled separately via direct
AgentThreadService calls.

## 7. Complete Integration Flow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

1. User runs artisan command with prompt
2. WorkflowBuilderService::startRequirementsGathering() called
3. Creates WorkflowBuilderChat and AgentThread
4. Uses AgentThreadService for planning conversation
5. LLM generates workflow plan based on requirements
6. Plan displayed to user for approval/correction
7. User feedback loop until plan approved

### Phase 2: Workflow Building

1. WorkflowBuilderService::startWorkflowBuild() called
2. Creates WorkflowInput with approved plan
3. Starts hard-coded builder workflow via WorkflowRunnerService
4. WorkflowDefinitionBuilderTaskRunner analyzes and outputs task specifications
5. TaskDefinitionBuilderTaskRunner processes each task in parallel
6. Workflow completes with task definition artifacts

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Completion

1. WorkflowRunUpdatedEvent fired when workflow completes
2. WorkflowListenerCompletedListener catches event
3. Routes to WorkflowBuilderService::processWorkflowCompletion()
4. Extracts artifacts and applies changes to database
5. Updates WorkflowBuilderChat status and broadcasts update

### Phase 4: Result Evaluation

1. WorkflowBuilderService::evaluateAndCommunicateResults() triggered
2. Creates new AgentThread for evaluation
3. Uses AgentThreadService to analyze build artifacts
4. Generates user-friendly summary and recommendations
5. Updates chat and broadcasts final results

### Phase 5: User Interaction

1. Artisan command receives broadcast events
2. Displays results to user
3. Prompts for next instruction
4. Returns to Phase 1 with new requirements

### Error Recovery:

1. Failed workflows identified in chat meta
2. Context preserved for manual recovery
3. Artisan command can resume from failure point
4. User notified of specific issues and recovery options

## 8. Event System & Broadcasting

### `app/Events/WorkflowBuilderChatUpdatedEvent.php`

**Fired when:**

- New artifacts added to chat
- New messages added to associated AgentThread
- Chat phase/status changes

**Payload:**

- WorkflowBuilderChat instance
- Update type (artifacts, messages, status)
- New data

### `app/Listeners/WorkflowBuilder/WorkflowBuilderCompletedListener.php`

**Handles WorkflowRunUpdatedEvent for builder workflows**

**Methods:**
`handle(WorkflowRunUpdatedEvent $event)`

- Calls WorkflowBuilderService::processWorkflowCompletion()
- Triggers result evaluation phase

## 9. Key Integration Points

**With Existing WorkflowRunnerService:**

- Uses standard workflow execution for builder workflow only
- Leverages existing artifact management
- Integrates with task process tracking

**With AgentThreadService:**

- Direct integration for planning and evaluation phases
- Uses existing response format handling
- Leverages JSON schema validation
- No custom wrappers or additional complexity

**With TaskRunnerService:**

- Custom runners follow established patterns
- Uses existing artifact flow mechanisms
- Integrates with process execution system

**With Event System:**

- Listens for WorkflowRun completion events
- Broadcasts WorkflowBuilderChat updates
- Enables real-time UI and command line updates

**With Team Scoping:**

- All models include team_id
- Inherits access control from base system
- Scoped queries automatic via repositories

## Summary

This simplified architecture removes unnecessary complexity while maintaining all required functionality. The
three-phase approach (requirements gathering → workflow building → result evaluation) provides clear separation of
concerns, and the event-driven completion enables real-time interaction via both artisan command and potential UI
implementations.
