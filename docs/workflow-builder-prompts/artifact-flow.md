# Artifact Flow Guide

## Overview

Artifacts are the data units that flow between workflow tasks, carrying content, metadata, and relationships. Understanding artifact flow is essential for designing efficient workflows that properly transform and route data through processing steps.

## Artifact Structure

### Core Components

**Content Types:**
- **text_content**: Raw text data and natural language content
- **json_content**: Structured data following JSON schemas
- **meta**: Workflow-specific metadata and processing information
- **file_path**: References to external files and resources

**Relationships:**
- **Parent-Child**: Artifacts created from other artifacts maintain parent relationships
- **Sibling**: Artifacts created in the same process share sibling relationships
- **Schema**: Artifacts may be associated with schema definitions for validation

**Metadata:**
- **Processing History**: Records of which tasks created or modified the artifact
- **Quality Indicators**: Confidence scores, validation flags, and quality metrics  
- **Source Information**: Origin tracking for audit and debugging purposes

## Artifact Modes

### Input Artifact Modes

**Standard Processing (null/default):**
```
[Artifact A, Artifact B, Artifact C] → Single Task Process → Output
```
- All input artifacts processed together in one task execution
- Task receives complete context from all inputs
- Optimal for tasks requiring cross-artifact analysis
- Higher memory usage but maintains full context

**Split Processing ("split"):**
```
[Artifact A, Artifact B, Artifact C] → [Process A, Process B, Process C] → Multiple Outputs
```
- Each input artifact processed separately in parallel
- Maximum parallelism and throughput
- Lower memory usage per process
- Ideal for independent processing tasks

### Output Artifact Modes

**Standard Output (""):**
```
Task Process → Single Output Artifact
```
- One artifact created per task execution
- Most common pattern for straightforward processing
- Clear 1:1 or many:1 input-output relationship

**Per Process Output ("Per Process"):**
```
[Process A, Process B, Process C] → [Output A, Output B, Output C]  
```
- One output artifact per parallel process
- Used with split input mode for 1:1 traceability
- Maintains individual processing results
- Enables granular result analysis

**Group All Output ("Group All"):**
```
[Process A, Process B, Process C] → Single Consolidated Output
```
- All process results merged into single artifact
- Useful for aggregation and summary tasks
- Reduces downstream complexity
- May lose granular traceability

## Artifact Levels

### Level Specification

Artifact levels control which parts of the data hierarchy are included in processing:

**Document Level:**
- Entire documents as single units
- Preserves document structure and context
- Suitable for document-wide analysis

**Page Level:**
- Individual pages from multi-page documents
- Enables page-specific processing
- Good balance between context and granularity

**Paragraph Level:**
- Text broken into paragraph chunks
- Fine-grained content analysis
- Higher processing volume but more detailed results

**Sentence Level:**
- Individual sentence processing
- Maximum granularity for text analysis
- Very high processing volume

### Level Configuration

**Input Artifact Levels:**
```json
{
  "input_artifact_levels": ["document", "page"]
}
```
- Specifies which levels to include from input artifacts
- Filters artifact hierarchy to relevant granularity
- Reduces processing overhead by excluding unnecessary levels

**Output Artifact Levels:**
```json
{
  "output_artifact_levels": ["summary", "details"]
}
```
- Defines structure of output artifacts
- Creates hierarchical outputs with multiple detail levels
- Enables flexible downstream consumption

## Flow Patterns

### Sequential Flow
```
Input → Process A → Process B → Process C → Output
```
**Characteristics:**
- Linear processing pipeline
- Each step depends on previous step completion
- Clear data transformation sequence
- Lower parallelism but predictable flow

**Use Cases:**
- Document processing pipelines
- Sequential analysis workflows
- Data validation and correction flows

### Parallel Flow
```
Input → [Process A, Process B, Process C] → Merge → Output
```
**Characteristics:**
- Independent parallel processing
- High throughput and resource utilization
- Requires merge or aggregation step
- Complex synchronization requirements

**Use Cases:**
- Content analysis across multiple dimensions
- Independent classification tasks
- Batch processing workflows

### Hierarchical Flow
```
Input → Split by Level → Process by Granularity → Aggregate Results → Output
```
**Characteristics:**
- Processing at different granularity levels
- Results aggregated back to higher levels
- Maintains hierarchical data relationships
- Complex but comprehensive analysis

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-level document analysis
- Hierarchical classification systems
- Detailed reporting with summary rollups

### Conditional Flow
```
Input → Classify → [Route A, Route B, Route C] → Conditional Merge → Output
```
**Characteristics:**
- Dynamic routing based on content characteristics
- Different processing paths for different data types
- Intelligent flow control
- Adaptive processing strategies

**Use Cases:**
- Content-type-specific processing
- Quality-based routing
- Dynamic workflow optimization

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

**Large Artifacts:**
- Monitor memory usage for large document processing
- Consider splitting strategies for memory optimization
- Use streaming processing for very large datasets
- Implement garbage collection for temporary artifacts

**Parallel Processing:**
- Balance parallelism with available system resources
- Monitor memory usage across parallel processes
- Consider disk-based storage for large artifact sets
- Implement back-pressure mechanisms

### Processing Efficiency

**Artifact Size Optimization:**
- Remove unnecessary content before processing
- Use appropriate artifact levels to filter data
- Compress large text content where possible
- Stream large datasets rather than loading entirely

**Flow Optimization:**
- Minimize unnecessary artifact copying
- Use efficient serialization formats
- Implement caching for frequently accessed artifacts
- Optimize connection patterns to reduce data movement

### Scalability Planning

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Design flows that can distribute across multiple workers
- Use stateless processing where possible
- Implement efficient load balancing for parallel tasks
- Monitor and adjust max_workers settings

**Vertical Scaling:**
- Optimize memory usage for larger artifact processing
- Use efficient data structures for artifact storage
- Implement memory pooling for high-throughput workflows
- Monitor CPU utilization patterns

## Debugging and Monitoring

### Artifact Tracing

**Parent-Child Relationships:**
- Track artifact lineage through processing steps
- Enable debugging of data transformation issues
- Provide audit trails for compliance requirements
- Support impact analysis for quality issues

**Processing History:**
- Record which tasks created or modified artifacts
- Track timing and performance metrics
- Log error conditions and recovery actions
- Maintain version history for critical artifacts

### Flow Monitoring

**Throughput Metrics:**
- Monitor artifacts processed per unit time
- Track processing latency across workflow steps
- Identify bottlenecks in artifact flow
- Measure end-to-end workflow performance

**Quality Metrics:**
- Track artifact validation success rates
- Monitor data quality indicators
