/**
 * Centralized API URL Configuration
 *
 * This module provides a single source of truth for all API endpoints
 * used throughout the application. All endpoints are organized by domain
 * and fully typed for type safety.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { apiUrls } from '@/api';
 * import { request } from 'quasar-ui-danx';
 *
 * // Simple usage
 * const response = await request.post(apiUrls.auth.login, credentials);
 *
 * // With ActionRoutes
 * const routes = useActionRoutes(apiUrls.agents.base);
 * ```
 */

// Export base configuration
export { API_BASE_URL, buildApiUrl, createUrlBuilder } from "./config";

// Import all domain endpoints
import { auth } from "./endpoints/auth";
import { agents } from "./endpoints/agents";
import { assistant } from "./endpoints/assistant";
