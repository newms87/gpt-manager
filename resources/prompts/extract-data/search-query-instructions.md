MINIMUM 3 search queries ordered from MOST SPECIFIC to LEAST SPECIFIC (exact match first, then progressively broader). Purpose: Find existing records efficiently - we check for exact matches first, then broaden if needed. Query 1: Most specific - use exact extracted values. Query 2: Less specific - key identifying terms. Query 3: Broadest - general concept only. Example for "Dr. John Smith": [{name: ["Dr.", "John", "Smith"]}, {name: ["John", "Smith"]}, {name: ["Smith"]}].
