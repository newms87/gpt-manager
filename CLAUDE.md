# GPT Manager - Agent Delegation Guide

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY AGENT DELEGATION (NO EXCEPTIONS!)

**YOU MUST DELEGATE ALL TECHNICAL WORK TO SPECIALIZED AGENTS**

### Agent Selection Rules:

**Laravel Backend Work:**
- **Architecture/Planning** â†’ `laravel-backend-architect` (REQUIRED for medium/large features)
- **Implementation** â†’ `laravel-backend-engineer` (ALL Laravel code writing)
- **Testing/QA** â†’ `laravel-backend-qa-tester` (EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY for tests)

**Vue Frontend Work:**
- **Architecture/Planning** â†’ `vue-spa-architect` (REQUIRED for medium/large features) 
- **Implementation** â†’ `vue-spa-engineer` (ALL Vue/Tailwind code writing)
- **Review/QA** â†’ `vue-spa-reviewer` (REQUIRED after code changes)

### Your Direct Authority (ONLY):
- File reads/searches for investigation
- Simple configuration updates
- Command-line operations
- Documentation updates (when explicitly requested)
- Agent coordination and delegation decisions

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT:**
1. Is this Laravel code? â†’ **MUST** delegate to Laravel agents
2. Is this Vue code? â†’ **MUST** delegate to Vue agents  
3. Is this a test? â†’ **ONLY** `laravel-backend-qa-tester` can write tests
4. Is it medium/large feature? â†’ **MUST** use architect agents first

## Core Project Principles

**ZERO TECH DEBT POLICY:**
- **ABSOLUTE ZERO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY** - No exceptions, ever
- **IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT ONLY** - Replace old code completely
- Always use current patterns exclusively
- Remove dead code immediately
- ONE correct way to do everything

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Always read existing implementations BEFORE any code work
- Never create custom patterns when established ones exist  
- Always delegate technical work to specialized agents
- Each agent has comprehensive guidelines for their domain

## Agent Workflow

**For All Technical Work:**

1. **Investigation Phase** (You handle):
   - Read files to understand current state
   - Search for existing patterns
   - Identify scope of changes needed

2. **Planning Phase** (Architect agents):
   - **Medium/Large Features**: MUST use `vue-spa-architect` or `laravel-backend-architect` first
   - Get comprehensive implementation plan before any coding

3. **Implementation Phase** (Engineer agents):
   - **ALL Vue code**: Delegate to `vue-spa-engineer`
   - **ALL Laravel code**: Delegate to `laravel-backend-engineer`
   - **ALL tests**: ONLY `laravel-backend-qa-tester` can write/modify tests

4. **Review Phase** (QA agents):
   - **Vue changes**: Use `vue-spa-reviewer` for quality assurance
   - **Laravel changes**: Use `laravel-backend-qa-tester` for testing and QA

## Reference Information

**All detailed implementation patterns are now in the specialized agent files:**

- **Laravel Backend**: See `LARAVEL_BACKEND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` and Laravel agent files in `.claude/agents/`
- **Vue Frontend**: See Vue agent files in `.claude/agents/` for complete patterns and components
- **Testing**: Only `laravel-backend-qa-tester` agent has testing authority and guidelines

**Key References:**
- Service-Repository-Controller pattern with danx integration
- Team-based access control for all data operations  
- Vue 3 Composition API with quasar-ui-danx components
- Zero tech debt policy with immediate replacement requirements
