description: |
  A list of meta data for the objects' property values being saved in the schema.
    * A new meta entry MUST be created for each scalar property with a non-null value
    * You can create a single entry for an entire object by providing the object property name instead of the individual child property names
    * If the value is null, DO NOT add a meta entry for that property
items:
  type: object
  additionalProperties: false
  required:
    - object_type
    - object_id
    - property_name
    - save_to_db
    - citation
  properties:
    object_type:
      type: string
      description: |
        The type (defined by the title) of the direct parent object
    object_id:
      type: string
      description: |
        The id of the direct parent object if given, otherwise the name of the direct parent object
    property_name:
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the property this meta entry references (ie: name, date, age, address, etc). DO NOT USE dot notation. This will never be a path like "team.name" or "teams[0].address.zip". ALWAYS use the direct property name (as the object_type/object_id will always be the direct parent).
    save_to_db:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Set to true if the value is non-null and was NOT derived from the DB (ie: teamObjects). Indicates to create or update property in DB. If set to false, citation must be set to null
    citation:
      type:
        - object
        - 'null'
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - date
        - confidence
        - reason
        - sources
      description: |-
        A citation of the source(s) of the property's value or the objects' child properties' values.

        Set citation to null if:
          * The value was explicitly set to null.
          * The value was derived directly from the database (e.g., teamObjects).
          * The value matches what is already stored in the database.

        When save_to_db is false:
          * citation must always be null.

        If the value originates from a message or a URL and provides a better (and different) answer than the database value:
          * Set citation to reference the source(s) and set save to true.
          * ALWAYS defer to the DB and set citation to null unless you are very confident the new value is better than the original.
      properties:

          description: The date (in format YYYY-MM-dd OR YYYY-MM-dd hh:mm:ss) related to the attribute's
            value (ONLY if data changes over time, otherwise null). ONLY set this value
            if it makes sense to plot in a time series! Leave null for names, descriptions,
            static properties, etc. Only set if there is an obvious date related to
            the value. Format should always be full date (and time if available). NO PARTIAL
            DATES!

          description: A brief explanation of why the value was chosen and why the confidence
            level was set to what it was. Try to include the context for the value (ie was mentioned in a section titled ... OR the name was mentioned, but unclear if it related to subject or something else).
