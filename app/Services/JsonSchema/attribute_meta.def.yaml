  A list of meta data for the objects' property values being saved in the schema. A new meta entry MUST be created for each scalar property of every object.
items:
  type: object

  required:
    - object_type
    - object_id
    - property_name
    - save_to_db
    - citation
  properties:
    object_type:
      type: string
      description: |
        The type of object defined by the object's title property.
    object_id:
      type: string
      description: |
        The id of the object if given, otherwise the name of the object
    property_name:
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the property this meta entry references (ie: name, date, age, etc)
    save_to_db:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Set to true if the value was NOT derived from the DB (ie: teamObjects). The value will be created or updated for the attribute in the DB. If set to false, citation must be null
    citation:
      type:
        - object
        - 'null'
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
        - date
        - confidence
        - reason
        - sources
      description: |-
        Set citation to null if:
          * The value was explicitly set to null.
          * The value was derived directly from the database (e.g., teamObjects).
          * The value matches what is already stored in the database.

        When save is false:
          * citation must always be null.

        If the value originates from a message or a URL and provides a better (and different) answer than the database value:
          * Set citation to reference the source(s) and set save to true.
          * ALWAYS defer to the DB and set citation to null unless you are very confident the new value is better than the original.

            value (ONLY if data changes over time, otherwise null). ONLY set this value
            if it makes sense to plot in a time series! Leave null for names, descriptions,
            static properties, etc. Only set date if there is an obvious date related to
            the value. Format should always be full date (and time if available). NO PARTIAL
            DATES!
