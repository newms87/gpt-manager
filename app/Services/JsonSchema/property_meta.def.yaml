title: Property Meta
description: |
  A list of metadata for the objects' property values saved in the schema.
      * Each scalar property that should be saved to the DB MUST have an entry.
      * You may create one entry for an entire object by specifying the object property name (all properties will be saved and share the same citations)
      * Adding a meta entry to a null value will delete the value from the DB
      * Set to null if there are no property values to cite / save to DB

    property_name:
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the property that should be saved to the DB (e.g., name, date, age, address, etc).
         * DO NOT use dot notation or paths like "team.name" or "teams[0].address.zip".
         * MUST refer to a direct child property.

      description: |-
        Citation of the source(s) for the property's value.
          * Set to `null` if:
            - The value is explicitly `null`.
            - The value is derived from the database (e.g., teamObjects).
            - The value matches what is already stored in the database.
          * If the value is sourced from a message, file or URL and improves upon the database value:
            - Reference the source(s) in the citation
            - Default to the database value unless confidence is high the new value is better.

          title: Reason
          type: string
          description: |-
            A concise explanation of why this value was selected and how the confidence level was determined.
            Provide context for the decision, such as:
              * Where the value was mentioned (e.g., "Found in a section titled X").
              * Any ambiguities or uncertainties (e.g., "The name was mentioned, but it was unclear if it referred to the subject or something else").
              * Aim to clearly justify both the value and the assigned confidence level.
        confidence:
          title: Confidence Level
          type: string
          description: |-
            The confidence level of the property value. Must be one of the following: "High", "Medium", "Low", "" (empty string). Leave blank if property value is null

            The source of the child property value.
            * Always use file_id if it is present instead of the URL (if you are sure the value came from the file)
            * Message IDs are ONLY found from <AgentMessage id="message_id"> tags in the thread. If no <AgentMessage> tags are present, DO NOT create a source w/ message_id property. These message sources apply ONLY to values found inside the <AgentMessage /> tags.
              * NEVER cite a message_id if it contains teamObjects data.
            * Use URL as a last resort to cite a source if message / file is not present
            * Make sure you include all relevant sources (more than one if others apply).
            * Set to null if property value was found outside of the <AgentMessage> tag and not in a URL / image / file, DO NOT add a source entry for it.
