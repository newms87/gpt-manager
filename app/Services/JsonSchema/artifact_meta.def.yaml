      Given the entire output response, generate a concise and descriptive name that will be used to label the artifact encapsulating your response. The name should be clear and informative for a human to understand the contents at a glance.

      Include the primary date (or date range) relevant to the response if there is a date given.
      DO NOT use today's date (unless it is stated in the content as the relevant date to the subject / context).
      If no date is explicitly stated from the input text, do not add a date in the name.
      Include the primary subject(s) (e.g., person, place, or thing being referenced) if it is given.
      Ensure the name is succinct yet comprehensive enough to distinguish it from other artifacts.
      Cite who created the artifact if information is given about Agent Name, Schema Name and/or Fragment Name (NOTE: ignore any of these fields in the citation if they are not explicitly stated)

      Example Format w/ date:
      [Date or Date Range] - [Primary Subject(s)] - [Brief Descriptor] by [Agent Name] using [Schema Name] ([Fragment Name])
        * "March 3rd, 2025 – Lake Powell Trip – Logistics Summary" by Travel Planning Agent using TravelPlans (Logistics)
        * "Q1 2025 – AI Workflow Integration – Technical Report" by AI Integration Team using AIWorkflow
        * "Daniel Newman - Client Data Extraction from Medical Summary" by Data Extraction Agent using Demand (Client)

      IMPORTANT: The name should be short and readable by a human at a glance. Use only what is necessary to uniquely identify the subject of the context (100 characters max)
