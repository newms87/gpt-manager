      Given the entire output response, generate a concise and descriptive name that will be used to label the artifact encapsulating your response. The name should be clear and informative for a human to understand the contents at a glance.

      Include the primary date (or date range) relevant to the response.
      Include the primary subject(s) (e.g., person, place, or thing being referenced).
      Ensure the name is succinct yet comprehensive enough to distinguish it from other artifacts.
      Example Format:
      [Date or Date Range] - [Primary Subject(s)] - [Brief Descriptor]

      Example Outputs:

      "2025-03-12 – Lake Powell Trip – Logistics Summary"
      "Q1 2025 – AI Workflow Integration – Technical Report"
      "2024-11-06 – Fantasy Football – Player Performance Outlook"
