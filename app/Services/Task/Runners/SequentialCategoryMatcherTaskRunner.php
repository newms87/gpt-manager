/**
 * The input artifacts are expected to have either meta or JSON content with a category resolved.
 * At least 1 input artifact must have a non-empty value for the category. The sequential matcher sorts all artifacts
 * by their position and attempts to match the artifacts w/ missing category values to the artifacts that have
 * non-empty category values either before or after the artifact in the sequence. This is performed using an LLM agent
 * with a prompt to attempt to intelligently match artifacts together into category groups.
 *
 *   - Artifacts with the `__exclude` category will be removed from the final output.
 *   - Artifacts will be sorted based on their `position` field.
 *   - Any artifact categorized with an empty value will attempt to be matched with other artifact categories that were
 *       identified before and after artifact in the sequence sorted list.
 *   - The final list of artifacts (after filtering and sorting) will be set as the output.
